# Welcome to The Pilot Club!

## About Us

The Pilot Club (TPC) is a free, friendly, thriving community for flight simulation enthusiasts.

We share our passion for aviation by doing group flights on VATSIM. Our goal is to engage in a meaningful and helpful discussion about flightsim topics, where we could learn from each other and share our experiences.

We are a proud member of the flightsim community and an official VATSIM partner. Our members are flightsim aviators of all skill levels, as well as real-world pilots, both private and commercial, and Air Traffic Controllers.

TPC pillars are: **T**eamwork, **P**assion, **C**ommunity.

**Welcome to The Pilot Club. Welcome to YOUR Club! Letâ€™s fly!**
