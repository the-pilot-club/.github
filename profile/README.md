# Welcome to The Pilot Club!

## About Us

The Pilot Club (TPC) is a free, friendly, thriving community for flight simulation enthusiasts.

We share our passion for aviation by doing group flights on VATSIM. Our goal is to engage in a meaningful and helpful discussion about flightsim topics, where we could learn from each other and share our experiences.

We are a proud member of the flightsim community and an official VATSIM partner. Our members are flightsim aviators of all skill levels, as well as real-world pilots, both private and commercial, and Air Traffic Controllers.

TPC pillars are: **T**eamwork, **P**assion, **C**ommunity.

**Welcome to The Pilot Club. Welcome to YOUR Club! Letâ€™s fly!**

## Our Development Team

Our Development Team exists of members of The Pilot Club who wish to put forth their time to help improve The Pilots Club's resources and web services.

Since Eric started the dev team, The Pilot Club has expanded its web resources to what it is today.

### Deputy Development Team Lead: Mike Melton

Mike joined the team to help improve TPCs web resources away from the old Windows server that TPC was on, and help migrate over to Kubernetes.
